Combined with BIONZ X image processing engine, the image sensor achieves a wide sensitivity range of ISO 100-51200 with low noise. The sensors quick-transmission copper wiring layer helps the camera to shoot movies in 4K and Full HD at 120fps (100fps). <b>425 phase-detection AF points with High-density Tracking AF Technology:</b><br/> With 425 focal plane phase-detection AF points helping to provide distinctively wide and dense AF point coverage, the ?6500 focuses accurately, efficiently and reliably on subjects throughout the frame. Also, High-density Tracking AF Technology seamlessly activates AF points to cover and track subjects moving within frame with unerring precision. <b>Fast Hybrid AF for stills and movies:</b><br/> The a6500 features the worlds fastest (0.05 sec.) AF speed. Such speed is achieved by integrating the Fast Hybrid AFs autofocusing performance plus the BIONZ X image processing engines highly efficient, accurate handling of information. This makes for extraordinarily fast, accurate AF and tracking performance when shooting movies or stills. (1) Point of focus (2) Contrast-detection AF (3) Phase-detection AF <b>In-body 5-axis image stabilization:</b><br/> The a6500 compensates for five types of camera shake, extending opportunities to shoot steadier still images and movies. The new high-accuracy gyro sensor provides an image stabilization effect equivaalent to a 5-steps-faster shutter speed.
