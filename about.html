                                <p>Leaders can exert incredible influence over the direction of a protest movement. The biggest example I can see of this is Mahatma Gandhi. As someone whose great-grandparents were followers of Gandhi, and at great personal expense (including jail time and the burning of tens of thousands of Rupees worth of British textiles) chose to follow in his mold as a freedom fighter. Prior to Gandhi joining the Indian National Congress, nobody within the Indian Independence Movement engaged in non-violent tactics. Even in a greater global context, we can see the impact of Gandhi as a leader as he was cited as a strong influence by influential leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and former South African President, Nelson Mandela. </p>

                                <p>On the flip side, thereâ€™s many movements, especially more recent movements with the advent of the internet and modern communication that are not reliant on a strong leader. For instance, in Venezuela, Interim President Juan Guaido is not a strong leader with a cult of personality, but it is the group of people behind him and the party he is representing that exemplify that you can have a protest movement (whether or not it will be successful is to be seen) without a strong leader; you just need a cause to rally behind.</p>

                                <p>In my own life, I personally was involved in the organization of the walkout at my high school last year. I was responsible for the recording and photography of the event. At the same time, I observed many people at neighboring high schools without such a politically active student body having very weak and very limited walk outs. Did the environment influence more or did the leadership and promotion at my school influence more? And whose idea was a national walkout anyways? This will be delved into, and more in this online forum.</p>
