									<h1>Leadership</h1>
									
								</header>
								<h3>Knowledge</h3>
                                <p>My leadership style is balanced between consensus and directive. I understand how to balance different opinions and make sure everyone has their voice heard. Many times I like to take an informal leadership role and direct people. I do ensure that I am following only consensus leadership in those times. However, when I am in a formal position, I will put my foot down and utilize directive leadership. I like to take a data driven approach and make sure that my decisions are justifiable beyond "I said so."</p>

                                <h3>Evidence</h3>
                                <p>To evidence my ideals on leadership you can read two of my papers.</p>

                                <h4>hi</h4>

                                <p>In my own life, I personally was involved in the organization of the walkout at my high school last year. I was responsible for the recording and photography of the event. At the same time, I observed many people at neighboring high schools without such a politically active student body having very weak and very limited walk outs. Did the environment influence more or did the leadership and promotion at my school influence more? And whose idea was a national walkout anyways? This will be delved into, and more in this online forum.</p>
