                                <p>I used this book to understand the influence of Mahatma Gandhi on Satyagraha Movement. He explains many of his ideologies in this book which helped me understand the state of a strong leader. This, coupled with my prior knowledge of the historical situation was beneficial in comprehending the effect of a leader on a movement. </p><br/>
                                
                                <blockquote>Lucks, Daniel S. Selma to Saigon : The Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. University Press of Kentucky, 2014.</blockquote>
                                <p>I used this book mostly to understand the anti-Vietnam protests and their successes/failures. This was one of the first movements without a strong leader that was extremely effective. Research from this book was the basis of my comment and rebuttal in the first page of my online forum.</p><br/>

                                <p>In my discussion on social media as a method of campaigning, I referenced the ability of a small organization to create a viral movement. This source, albeit a non-traditional source, constituted a primary source from which I could create my own insights and deduce my own conclusions, resulting in somewhat of original research on my behalf.</p><br/>
                                
                                <blockquote>Gautney, Heather. “What Is Occupy Wall Street? The History of Leaderless Movements.” The Washington Post, WP Company, 10 Oct. 2011, www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/what-is-occupy-wall-street-the-history-of-leaderless-movements/2011/10/10/gIQAwkFjaL_story.html?utm_term=.3fd9d4b0e658.</blockquote>
                                <p>Originally, I was planning on extensively discussing the Women‘s March, but I realized that movement is too new and has not been around for long enough. Therefore, I committed myself towards researching older, leaderless movements and found this extremely helpful article on the Occupy movement. This is not the only source I used on the Occupy movement, but its positionment as a popular source online aided me in finding out about Occupy. </p><br/>
                                
                                <blockquote>Lapowsky, Issie. “The Women's March Defines Protest in the Facebook Age.” Wired, Conde Nast, 3 June 2017, www.wired.com/2017/01/womens-march-defines-protest-facebook-age/.</blockquote>
                                <p>Still, even if I wasn’t investigating the Women’s march as a leaderless organization, I could easily use it as a case-study on how social media could be used to spread a specific movement. This article by WIRED did a very good job at taking the pulse of America as it reacted to the Trump presidency and gave insight into how the Women’s March spread so quickly and efficiently.</p><br/>
                                
                                <blockquote>Morgan, Iwan W, and Philip Davies. From Sit-Ins to Sncc : The Student Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. University Press of Florida, 2012. </blockquote>
                                
                                <p>One of the first leaderless organizations that came to mind when I started this investigation was SNCC, a key organization in the Civil Rights movement. They were one of the first organizations to embody grassroots organization structurally and paved the way for many more organizations to come. My research would be limited in scope if I did not use this book to read about them and learn about their successes and failures. </p><br/>
